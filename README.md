# Off-Campus-Housing-Information-System

This was a semester-long project created at Rutgers University during Spring 2022. Our team noticed the struggle college students have when searching for off-campus housing near their university. We would like to solve this problem by creating a web-based application geared towards helping students find apartments quickly, efficiently, and safely. Our project proposal can be found [here](Proposal.pdf).
